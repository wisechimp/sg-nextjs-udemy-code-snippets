This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), but you probably managed to work that out for yourself, smart!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

Right so this project is part of Stephen Grinder's [Next JS: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/next-js-the-complete-developers-guide/) which was actively updated in January 2024, (which was recent when I originally typed this!) hosted on the Udemy platform.

It may be a little out of date (Next moves pretty fast!) but this guide to adding a deployed database and connecting it to the project was quite helpful as it's something I added to the project. In the course the project isn't deployed and simply employs Prisma locally:
